# Remov.exe
## This Repository contains a python scripts that has some automation functionality
Many of the people offline conding in some of the text editors like vscode or any other.
We Compile code and a exe file got created and day by day its no. increases which takes a lot of storage as compared to our code files.
If we want to delete those we need to select them and delete them.
### for that purpose i have written this script so that on running it  , it collects all the exe files from the given folder and put it in a specific folder , from where you can delete those manually.
